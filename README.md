# Computation-Geometry
An C++ based computation geometry library, used to find the relathionship between geometry shapes.

Done:
- [x] Implementation of GJK algorithm
- [x] Implementation of Separate Axis Theorem algorithm

Todo:
- [ ] add computations of distance if two shapes do not collide.
- [ ] add more test
- [ ] add other collision detection algorithms
  - [ ] AABB-surrogate
  - [ ] circle-surrogate
